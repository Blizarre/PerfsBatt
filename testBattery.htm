<h1>Why?</h1>

Evaluate the effectiveness/cost ratio of several battery brands.
I have been doing photography and caving for several years now, and I have used a lot of rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries on flash, LED lamp etc.

I had a few questions:

<ul>
<li>I observed that the batteries that worked so well on my headlamp were almost useless on my flash, so I wanted to investigate why.</li>
<li>I used only cheap batteries because of their very low cost. Would it be cost-effective to buy better ones?</li>
</ul>

<h1>Methodology</h1>

<p>I knew from various sources that rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries have a very different-looking discharge curve, 
and that the "capacity" could vary greatly depending on the output. Therefore I measured the intensity of the current on my headlamp 
at medium power (around 200mA), which is equivalent to a resistance of 7.5 Ohm. I took the closest one I got at 5.6 Ohm:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tr><th>Voltage (V)</th><th>Current (mA)</tr>
<tr><td>1.5</td><td>268 mA</td></tr>
<tr><td>1.3</td><td>232 mA</td></tr>
<tr><td>1.1</td><td>196 mA</td></tr>
</table>

The current values are above 200mA, but this is not a problem since my headlamp is fairly low power, and I plan to get (or make) a more powerful one.

<p><b>TLRD; I measured the discharge graph of batteries on a 5.6 Ohm load to match my gear.</b></p>

<h1>Results</h1>

<h2>Test Material</h2>

<p>I used this little project described <a href="index.html">Here</a> to get the discharge curves. I compared 6 different brands, and 2 Ni-Mh rechargeable batteries.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tr><th>Brand name			</th> <th>Price	(&euro;)	</th><th>Type	</th></tr>
<tr><td>Amazon Basics		</td><td>0.40		</td><td>Alkaline</td></tr>
<tr><td>Carrefour Discount	</td><td>0.25		</td><td>Alkaline</td></tr>
<tr><td>Discount One (old)	</td><td>0.30		</td><td>Alkaline</td></tr>
<tr><td>IKEA Alkaline		</td><td>0.40		</td><td>Alkaline</td></tr>
<tr><td>Energizer Ultra+	</td><td>1.18		</td><td>Alkaline</td></tr>
<tr><td>VARTA High Energy	</td><td>1.02		</td><td>Alkaline</td></tr>
<tr><td>Conrad				</td><td>3.70		</td><td>Ni-Mh 2500mAh</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Variability</h2>

<image src="images/variability.png" alt="Evaluation of the variability of the discharge for the same brand"/>

<p>The first step is to ensure that the variability of measurements is not too high. If it was the case, the study 
would have to be made several times for every brand, which would be impractical. The measurements are made on 5 different 
Amazon essential batteries, from 2 different packages. The two packages were bought at the same time, so they a probably 
from the same batch. The results are very similar for all of them.</p>

<h2>Discharge curves</h2>

<h2>Discharge time</h2>
<image src="images/discharge11.png" alt="Discharge time to 1.1V"/><p/>

<image src="images/discharge13.png" alt="Discharge time to 1.3V"/>

<p>As usual, you get what you pay for. The branded batteries show better performances than the discounts. However, 
the difference is only in the range of a 5 to 20% improvement. 
The Carrefour Discount as well as the IKEA batteries are very good, on par with the brand ones. However, the other 
ones hold a significantly lower charge.</p>

<h2>Discharge time corrected</h2>

<p><image src="images/discharge13E.png" alt="Discharge time to 1.3V, taking into account the price"/></p>

<p>You get what you pay for, right? Well, not really. Every increase in performance 
comes at a greater cost, and the batteries are no exception. The pricing difference is so large (>500%) that 
the small increase in performance is annihilated when you look at your wallet.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Well, those results are not unexpected. If you <b>need</b> the best batteries available, for a critical project, 
take the brand batteries. Well, if it is so important, you should even take li-ion non rechargeable batteries, which are 
supposed to last a lot longer (and cost a lot more, that's why they aren't in this test). For everything else, 
the cheaper ones are better.</p>
