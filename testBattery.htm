<h1>Why ?</h1>

Evaluate the effectiveness/cost ratio of several battery brand. 

I have been doing photography and caving for several years now, and I have used a lots of rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries on flash, LED lamp etc.

I had a few questions :

<ul>
<li>I observed that the batteries that worked so well on my headlamp were almost useless on my flash, so I wanted to investigate why.</li>
<li>I used only cheap batteries because of their very low cost. Would it be cost-effective to buy better ones ?</li>
</ul>

<h1>Methodology</h1>

I knew for various web source that rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries have a very different-looking discharge curve, and that the "capacity" could very greatly depending on the output. So I measured the intensity of the current on my headlamp at medium power (around 200mA), wich mean an equivalent resistance of 7.5 Ohm. I took the closest one I got at 5.6 Ohm :

<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tr><th>Voltage (V)</th><th>Current (mA)</tr>
<tr><td>1.5</td><td>268 mA</td></tr>
<tr><td>1.3</td><td>232 mA</td></tr>
<tr><td>1.1</td><td>196 mA</td></tr>
</table>

The current values are above 200mA, but this is not a problem since my headlamp is fairly low power, and I plan to get (or make) a more powerful one.
